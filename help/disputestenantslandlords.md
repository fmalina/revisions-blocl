Issues and disputes with other tenants and landlords
====================================================

We always advise tenants and landlords to sort out any issues and disputes
sooner rather than later, it’s always best to live together being happy rather
than unhappy. Issues can normally vary from loud music, untidiness, rent, having
friends around, other tenants, smoking and contents damage.


Issues and disputes with another tenant
---------------------------------------


If you have any issues with other tenants it’s always best to have a quick word
and come to an easy resolution, if this doesn’t resolve the issue then contact
your landlord to help resolve it, if the issue is still not resolved you can
check legally where you stand, but if you feel you want to leave then explain
the situation to the landlord and give them the [required
notice](/help/giving-notice-to-leave) in your [tenancy
agreement](/help/tenancy-agreements).


Issues and disputes with your landlord
--------------------------------------


If you have any issues or disputes it’s always best to discuss these as soon as
possible to help resolve the problem.    i.e.: If your rent is due on Monday and
you don’t have the money till Friday, then tell the landlord beforehand. Don’t
stay quiet and have the landlord ring you asking where’s the money.


If issues are more serious then have another conversation and if there is no
resolution you can check legally where you stand or you may ask to leave or the
landlord may ask you to leave, then you would refer back to your tenancy
agreement and the law on the period of notice that has to be given and ask the
landlord whether your [deposit](/help/taking-deposits-and-legislation) is
going to be affected.


When renting rooms, consider having [tenant
insurance](/help/tenant-and-student-insurance) and ask the landlord for a
[tenancy agreement](/help/tenancy-agreements) this will help towards any
future issues. Always check legally where you stand.
