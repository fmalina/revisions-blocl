Tenancy agreements
==================
Tenancy agreements are a big part of room and property rental, and are the first
thing you should have in place before deposit is paid. Tenancy agreements create
an agreement between the landlord, and the tenant or lodger.

These agreements will help ensure the tenancy runs smoothly and sets out

* the rent required,
* deposit needed,
* term of the tenancy,
* required notice period to end the tenancy,
* inventory of owner possessions, etc.

This agreement should also outline the commitments of the tenant with terms
like:

* To pay rent on time,
* not to damage the property,
* to keep room or property in a good clean state,
* not to become an annoyance to the owner, etc.

It lets the tenant know what’s expected of them, so they can enjoy their tenancy.
If any future disputes happen landlord can refer the tenant back to the tenancy
agreement and vice versa. Without one anyone may say they don't remember
agreeing to that.

Always read tenancy agreements fully, so you understand what’s written in them
and sign both copies, you then keep one copy and the other side keeps the other.

Lodger agreement
----------------
A **lodger agreement** is best for landlords who let out rooms in their own
furnished home, where both parties will agree on a period of tenancy and these
agreements will normally have an early termination clause meaning if the lodger
or the landlord want to end the tenancy early this clause would state the amount
of notice that needs to be given. This will give landlords more freedom and
flexibility towards their own home and let the tenant know what is required of
them and rules they have to abide by to keep the agreement valid. Free templates

Assured shorthold tenancy agreement
-----------------------------------
These are relevant for a non-resident landlord letting out rooms in a property.

An assured shorthold tenancy agreement is the most commonly used Tenancy
Agreement and is used where rooms or a whole property are rented where the
landlord doesn't live. These agreements will have a stated period of tenancy,
and can be ended after the relevant notice on the agreement is given. Agreement
can only be ended earlier than the initial period if the tenant and the landlord
both agree or clauses in the contract are broken. These also give tenants piece
of mind and privacy as the landlord should ask the tenants' permission before he
or she enters the premises, giving the required notice.
