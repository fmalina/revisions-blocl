room, property and facilities with a detailed description with good photos and
maybe even a video, this should then filter down a good selection of tenants
increasing your chances of finding the ideal tenant quicker.

on your advert, update details if needed and click save on the bottom of the
form. This will get your advert back to the top, editing your ad or turning it
back on after if was turned off will always get your advert back to the top of
the listings.


5. Reading tenant adverts

of tenant adverts, make sure you read the adverts carefully spotting the one you
really like.


6. Save your favourite tenant adverts
-------------------------------------

down the list again.

This is where you can give a fuller description of the room and property, create
a check-list of details you need from them, start with their name, contact
number and a mobile number. Ask if they’re working or a student, reason for
moving, do they have any pets or children, do they smoke and do they have
references and importantly how long are they looking to rent for, etc. remember
to make a note of all your appointments.


8. Before the viewing
---------------------


Make sure the [room is ready, clean and presentable](/p25). Have a tidy around
the house cleaning any dishes etc., have a list of any more questions you may
need to ask.


9. Showing them the room and property
-------------------------------------


When tenants arrive to the viewing see if there well presented, take your time
and give them a good look around the house not just the room, explain the
benefits and talk about the local area, access to the town or popular places
etc., advising them as to the rent and bond details and when future rent is due.
This is where you can ask a bit more about their circumstances and get a clearer
picture of the potential tenant, then see if their interested.


10. Are they suitable
---------------------


Now it’s time to [decide if they are suitable](/p29), some landlords will make a
decision straight away and others may wait for more viewings and make a decision
later, remember not to make a rash decision as you will be living with the
tenant for the foreseeable future, once you have made your mind up ask the
potential tenant for their deposit and first month’s rent and you have yourself
a new tenant.
