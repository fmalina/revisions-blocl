No response to communication
============================
We know what it’s like when you think you’ve found the perfect room by reading the ad. You give the landlord a phone call but no answer. You sent him an email yesterday but no reply. Just remember before thinking the worst that the room might have already gone: Be patient. Ringing 50 times and sending 20 e-mails might not be the answer.


Some landlords take longer to respond than others. They could just be off on holiday, busy working or got the family around etc, but if you are calling for a couple of days and still no reply I might take that as a hint the room has gone. If it has gone [search](/search) the site to check new listings.


Every email you send is sent to the landlord’s personal email and their account inbox, so there’s more chance they'll see it.
