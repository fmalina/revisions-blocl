Tenant and student insurance
============================

When living in rented or shared accommodation it can be difficult to find the
right level of cover at the right price to insure your belongings, with some
people leaving it too late having to payout for a new laptop because they
dropped it, or the tenant next door has just left and your TV seems to be
missing. To help look after our users we recommend users to search for
some experts in providing tenants' insurance.
They understand your insurance has to be flexible and offer a range of specially
designed low cost policies to suit you.
If you're a student search for specially designed student insurance.

"When I graduated from university I could not afford to buy my own home, so I
remained in rented accommodation which was a shared house. As a tenant,
they found me affordable contents insurance, and I could pay it monthly.
When I came to claim they were excellent. There was almost no paperwork to
complete and the process was painless. I would definitely recommend them to
renters for household insurance."


Student insurance
=================
If you're a full-time student then student contents insurance can
cover your possessions in your house, flat or halls of residence and can be
tailored to cover all the items that you take to university too. You can build a
policy that insures just one item, or a policy that covers your bike, laptop,
iPod, camera, DVDs and much more.
