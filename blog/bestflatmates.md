Probably The Best Flatmates In The World
========================================
"Carlsberg Don't do Flatmates TV Commercial". This video was
an advert from a few years ago showing football fan's best flatmates in the world.

Man responding to an ad in the paper for a room to rent, turns up and is greeted
by a classy woman, who likes football, a laid back guy,
and another girl who won't let anyone else cook.

The laid back guy shows him around the flat, showing off a wall gadget that
sucks up mess at the touch of a button, then apologises for him having the box room.
They enter the room. It's huge with batchelor pad style decorations,
they go onto the balcony and see... the balcony overlooks a football stadium.

This ad amused many people when it came out and has been re released a few
times to go out before big football matches.

Is this what you want in a flat share? I'm sure football fans would agree, but we
can't all be so lucky so what is important in a good flatmate?
