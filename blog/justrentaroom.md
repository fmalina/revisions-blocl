Justrentaroom is now part of Blocl
==================================

Since 2001 JustRentARoom helped countless
lodgers and landlords to form their ideal house shares and flat shares, renting
out rooms in the UK. Today the site became part of Blocl UK

Justrentaroom was the 1st of its kind in the UK, pioneering the way rooms are
rented today. Blocl is proud to continue the heritage moving
forward.

Landlords and lodgers can [post adverts directly to Blocl](/rooms/post).

Thank you Angela
