Refunds
-------


As we offer an online service which is activated instantly after upgrading, we
cannot offer a refund as your exposure and service has already started. This
refund policy is in accordance with the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling)
Regulations 2000.


Map positions
-------------


We use Google maps to show the approximate location of your property based on
your postcode. In some cases the position is wrong. You can easily edit your
advert and manually move the map marker position by placing the marker on your
property.


Updates
-------


Updates to the website can temporarily affect service and premium memberships.


Search engines
--------------


Search engines such as Bing, Google and others crawl this site and user adverts
may appear in their search results.


Advert description contact details
----------------------------------


Members have a specific area when signing up to enter their email address,
surnames and phone number. We don’t allow phone numbers, web addresses, email
addresses, surnames, terms like "view me on Facebook" or terms that guide people
away from our site in advert descriptions. This keeps the website profitable so
users can enjoy a great service. Members that do put details like the above in
the description will lead to their advert taking longer to approve as we have to
manually delete these details and users will fill their rooms slower.


Advert preferences & equality
-----------------------------


Language preference will be accommodated where possible. Use of gender, age,
sexual orientation and other preferences is left to the sole discretion of our
members.


Advert Availability
-------------------


We keep our website up to date with active adverts from landlord and tenants,
but on some occasions landlords and tenants will forget to tell us their room
has been filled and may ignore our reminder emails, we cannot be held
accountable for this. This is annoying to us as much as our members but we do
automatically turn adverts off if members haven't logged in for a sensible
amount of time. We can't turn adverts off automatically too early as we'd be
turning off valid adverts and would annoy lot of our members.


Advert Descriptions
-------------------


We cannot be held responsible for what members write in these descriptions or
the truthfulness of what they write, include or don't include.


Message Descriptions
--------------------


We cannot be held responsible for what members write in messages or the
truthfulness of what they write, include or don't include.


Advertising authority
---------------------


If we have been made aware you don’t have the authority to advertise your room
or property we reserve the right to turn off your advert.
