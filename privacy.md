Introduction
------------


1. This is a notice to inform you of our policy about all information that we record about you. It sets out the conditions under which we may process any information that we collect from you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could identify you (“personal information”) and information that could not. In the context of the law and this notice, “process” means collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information.
2. We regret that if there are one or more points below with which you are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our website immediately.
3. We take seriously the protection of your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all visitors to our website are entitled to know that their personal data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party.
4. We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us, and hope that you reciprocate.
5. Our policy complies with UK law accordingly implemented, including that required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
6. Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any information collected through our website.


The bases on which we process information about you
---------------------------------------------------


The law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process
different categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the
basis for each category.


If a basis on which we process your personal information is no longer relevant
then we shall immediately stop processing your data.


If the basis changes then if required by law we shall notify you of the change
and of any new basis under which we have determined that we can continue to
process your information.


Information we process because we have a contractual obligation with you
------------------------------------------------------------------------


When you create an account on our website or buy service from us, or otherwise
agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.


In order to carry out our obligations under that contract we must process the
information you give us. Some of this information may be personal information.


We may use it in order to:


1. verify your identity for security purposes
2. provide you with our services
3. provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from using our website


We process this information on the basis there is a contract between us, or that
you have requested we use the information before we enter into a legal contract.


Additionally, we may aggregate this information in a general way and use it to
provide class information, for example to monitor our performance with respect
to a particular service we provide. If we use it for this purpose, you as an
individual will not be personally identifiable.


We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends
or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.


Information we process with your consent
----------------------------------------


Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship
between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us to provide you more
information about our business, including job opportunities and our products and
services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be
personal information.


Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this
information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of cookies.


Sometimes you might give your consent implicitly, such as when you send us a
message by e-mail to which you would reasonably expect us to reply.


Except where you have consented to our use of your information for a specific
purpose, we do not use your information in any way that would identify you
personally. We may aggregate it in a general way and use it to provide class
information, for example to monitor the performance of a particular page on our
website.


If you have given us explicit permission to do so, we may from time to time pass
your name and contact information to selected associates whom we consider may
provide services or products you would find useful.


We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your
consent or it can be reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.


You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us. However, if you do
so, you may not be able to use our website or our services further.


Information we process for the purposes of legitimate interests
---------------------------------------------------------------


We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either
to you or to us, of doing so.


Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given
careful consideration to:


* whether the same objective could be achieved through other means
* whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm
* whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to do so


For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of:


* record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our business
* responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a response
* protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party
* insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is required to manage business risk
* protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so


Information we process because we have a legal obligation
---------------------------------------------------------


We are subject to the law like everyone else. Sometimes, we must process your
information in order to comply with a statutory obligation.


For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they
so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or
court order.


This may include your personal information.


Specific uses of information you provide to us
----------------------------------------------


Information provided on the understanding that it will be shared with a third party
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our website allows you to post information with a view to that information being
read, copied, downloaded, or used by other people.


Examples include:


1. Posting an advert
2. Messaging another user


In posting personal information, it is up to you to satisfy yourself about the
privacy level of every person who might use it.


Once your information enters the public domain, we have no control over what any
individual third party may do with it. We accept no responsibility for their
actions at any time.


Provided your request is reasonable and there is no legal basis for us to retain
it, then at our discretion we may agree to your request to delete personal
information that you have posted.


Complaints regarding content on our website
===========================================


We attempt to moderate user generated content, but we are not always able to do
so as soon as that content is published or due to the volume of content posted.


If you complain about any of the content on our website, we shall investigate
your complaint.


If we feel it is justified or if we believe the law requires us to do so, we
shall remove the content while we investigate.


Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a judgment as to whose
right will be obstructed: yours, or that of the person who posted the content
that offends you.


If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not
correspond with you about it.


Information relating to your method of payment
----------------------------------------------


If a Payment is made via PayPal the payment information is never taken by us or
transferred to us either through our website or otherwise. Our employees and
contractors never have access to it. At the point of payment, you are
transferred to a secure page on the website of PayPal


If a Payment is made via a credit or debit card we store information about your
debit or credit card or other means of payment when you first provide it to us.


We store this payment information in order to make repeat purchasing of goods
and services easier next time you visit our website or if you have opted for
recurring billing.


We also store it to help us prevent fraud.


We take the following measures to protect your payment information:


1. We keep your payment information encrypted on our servers.
2. Access to your payment information is restricted to authorised staff only.
3. If we ask you questions about your payment information, we only show the last four digits of the credit or debit card number, so that you can identify the means of payment to which we refer.


We automatically delete your payment information on request or when a credit or
debit card expires.


Job application and employment


If you send us information in connection with a job application, we may keep it
for up to three years in case we decide to contact you at a later date.


If we employ you, we collect information about you and your work from time to
time throughout the period of your employment. This information will be used
only for purposes directly relevant to your employment. After your employment
has ended, we will keep your file for six years before destroying or deleting
it.


Sending a message to our support team
-------------------------------------


When you contact us, whether by telephone, through our website or by e-mail, we
collect the data you have given to us in order to reply with the information you
need.


We record your request and our reply in order to increase the efficiency of our
business.


We keep personally identifiable information associated with your message, such
as your name and email address so as to be able to track our communications with
you to provide a high quality service.


Complaining
-----------


When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have given to us.


We use that information to resolve your complaint.


If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other person, we may
decide to give to that other person some of the information contained in your
complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our
sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and if we do, what that
information is.


We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to
assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you
or any other person.


Affiliate and business partner information
