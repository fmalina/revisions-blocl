Top 10 tips to finding the right room 
======================================
Below we have put together a list of things you should consider and keep in mind when finding the right room.


1. **Search daily**  

 Logging on often is going to give you the best chance of finding a room. Rooms are being added regularly with some rooms going as quick as couple of hours.
2. **Create a room wanted advert**  

[Creating a room wanted advert](/p36) with a great description and photo will increase your chances of finding a room quicker. This will work for you all the time, as people who have rooms will offer them to you instead.
3. **Check your e-mail regularly**  

 When you get chance, have a quick check. You’ll be receiving messages from other interested members, list of new rooms to let and advice from us. You can always manage email preferences under [your details](/details).
4. **Renew your advert**  

 Making changes to your ad will get it back to the top of the listings.
5. **Reading room adverts**  

 Read the adverts carefully to make sure the house has what you need e.g. car parking, internet, dryer etc.
6. **Save your favourite adverts**  

 Remember to save your favourite adverts so you don’t have to go trawling right down the list again.
7. **Contacting landlords**  

 When contacting landlords via email or phone, prepare a list of questions about the property, the current tenants etc. If it’s still suitable ask for a viewing. Remember to make a note of the day and time of the viewing.
8. **Before you view**  

 Try to get a friend or family member to view the property with you. This will give you a great perspective on the property and a 2nd opinion. They may spot flaws you may not have noticed. Most importantly, this is safer for you.  

 Also draw up a [checklist](/p32) and note any extra questions.
9. **Viewing the room and property**  

 Arrive to the property early in a neat dress. Have a look around the area first. Does it feel safe? Is parking an issue? Are there local shops etc. Take your time through the viewing. Asking any questions that come to mind. Get a full idea of the people you will be living with.
10. **Decision time**  

 When [deciding on the right property](/p37), remember you’ll be living there for the foreseeable future. Don’t make a rash decision unless you feel entirely comfortable. Once decided be prepared with the first month’s rent and [bond to secure the property](/p16).
