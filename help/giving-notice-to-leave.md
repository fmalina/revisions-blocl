⏱️ Giving notice to leave
=========================
When it is time to move on, give your landlord the required noticed stated on
your tenancy agreement and if the property / room is in good order and there is
no unpaid rent, damage etc you will receive all you deposit back.


Disputes
--------


If there are any disputes involving your deposit at the end of the tenancy try
to resolve the issue in this order.


1. Talk to the landlord and discuss you concerns and see if you can reach an agreement.
2. Was your deposit paid in to a [tenancy deposit scheme](paying-deposits-and-legislation). If so call these for help and advice (they are there to help).
3. If you still need help and advice contact your local Citizens Advice Centre or the County Court.
