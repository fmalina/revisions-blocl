Making my bills cheaper
=======================
When renting rooms youâ€™ll normally find your monthly bills will go up, due to
more water, electric, gas etc being used daily. The best way to help combat this
is to advise your tenants not to leave showers running and not having the
heating on when not necessary etc. Another thing to consider is: are you paying
too much? Have you taken 5 minutes out to see if there are any better deals out
there? If you answered no check out [uSwitch](http://bit.ly/7c2URw). It is a
