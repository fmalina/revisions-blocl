Why provide internet access? Broadband & WiFi
=============================================
Offering internet access to your tenants can be a big deciding factor when tenants are choosing the right place to live, as the web is a day to day necessity in many people’s lives.


Most internet broadband packages these days will allow wireless access (WiFi). It will enable you and your tenants to use the internet anywhere around the house instead of being restricted by cables.


If you currently have the internet but not WiFi this can normally be arranged by calling your provider.


If you don’t already have internet access or are considering getting the internet there are many good deals out there. Below we have listed some good broadband providers we have personally used.


* [BE There](http://www.bethere.co.uk) - recommended, 3 month contracts are also available.
* [Virgin Media](http://store.virginmedia.com/broadband.html) - if you are looking to use Virgin TV take the broadband with it. Might not be available in your area.
