Taking deposits and legislation
===============================
When renting it is highly recommended you take a security deposit off your
[tenants](/p15) which is normally the equivalent of one month’s rent or a set
rate, so as new tenants move in they should pay there 1st month’s rent up front
and there set deposit. We always advise landlords that this should be the
minimum standard before taking on new tenants as this sets in place what’s
expected in the future.


Why do I need to take a deposit?
--------------------------------


Deposits are taken for security for the property in the possibility that you
suffer financial loss during the tenancy, if this occurs landlords could make
reasonable deductions from the deposit for:


* Unpaid rent or bills
* Missing items
* Cleaning
* Damage to the property


Normal wear and tear is not considered as financial loss.


If items are damaged beyond repair or are lost, you should replace the item on a
like for like basis i.e. if the item damaged was a 10 year old TV you shouldn’t
ask the tenant to pay for a brand new widescreen LCD.


Remember to keep receipts for any replacements or work done.


Deposit legislation
-------------------


The below legislation does not affect landlords who let out rooms in their own
home where they live.


As part of the Housing Act 2004 the government has introduced tenancy deposit
protection for all [assured shorthold tenancies](/ta-shorthold) (ASTs) in
England and Wales only where deposits are taken. From April 6th 2007, all
deposits paid under an AST have had to be protected within 14 days of receipt by
the landlord.


The legislation wants to ensure that tenant’s who have paid a deposit to a
landlord or letting agent and are entitled to receive all or part of it back at
the end of that tenancy, actually get it and assist resolving disputes regarding
the refund of deposits.


Who is affected?
----------------


The legislation covers virtually all new AST contracts through which private
landlords let property in England and Wales.


However, the following will not need to be registered with a tenancy deposit
protection scheme:


* Resident Landlords (those living in the property).
* Landlords of properties with rent of over £25,000 a year.
* Company lets.
* Student accommodation let directly by universities or colleges.


Who do I register the deposit with.


[The Government](https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-deposit-protection) has awarded
contracts to run tenancy deposit protection schemes to 3 companies.


The most popular service is the:


The Deposit Protection Service (The DPS)
----------------------------------------


[The DPS](http://www.depositprotection.com/) is the only custodial deposit
protection scheme, is free to use and open to all Landlords and Letting Agents.
The service is funded entirely from the interest earned from deposits held.
Landlords and Letting Agents will be able to register and make transactions
online. Paper forms will also be available should internet access be an issue.
The scheme will be supported by a dedicated call centre and an independent
dispute resolution service.


The other two companies run insurance backed schemes, these also have benefits
too as landlords look after the deposit but pay a fee to use the service.


Tenancy Deposit Solutions Ltd (TDSL)
------------------------------------


[TDSL](http://www.mydeposits.co.uk/) also known as My Deposits is a partnership
between the National Landlords Association and Hamilton Fraser Insurance. This
insurance-based tenancy deposit protection scheme enables landlords, either
directly or through agents, to hold deposits. Letting agents can also join the
scheme.


The Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS)
--------------------------------


[TDS](http://www.thedisputeservice.co.uk) is an insurance-backed deposit
protection and dispute resolution scheme run by The Dispute Service that builds
on a scheme established in 2003 to provide dispute resolution and complaints
handling for the lettings industry. The new scheme enables letting agents and
landlords to hold deposits.
