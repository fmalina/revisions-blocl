Employing a housekeeper
=======================
If you’re renting several rooms in a property, then it may be a good idea to
consider hiring a housekeeper. With multiple tenants in a house things could
start getting a little untidy. Maybe the kitchen surface isn’t getting cleaned
as good as it should, the oven’s dirty or house could do with a good clean, this
is where housekeepers can work a treat and can also help to reduce wear and tear
to your property.


Hiring a housekeeper to come around once a week or fortnight can be a massive
boost to your offer and doesn’t cost the earth either. You can normally arrange
for someone to meet the housekeeper at the property or simply drop a key off
with them and they can come and go with no hassle. This is also another great
selling point when getting tenants.


Housekeepers can normally be found in your local newspaper or yellow pages,
remember to get at least 3 quotes to compare and to check up after the first
visit that they have done a good job.
