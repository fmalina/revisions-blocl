Why provide internet access? Broadband & Wi-Fi
==============================================
Offering internet access to your tenants can be a big deciding factor when
tenants are choosing the right place to live, as the web is a day to day
necessity in many peopleâ€™s lives.

Most internet broadband packages these days will allow wireless access (WiFi).
It will enable you and your tenants to use the internet anywhere around the
house instead of being restricted by cables.

If you currently have the internet but not WiFi this can normally be arranged by
calling your provider.

If you don't already have internet access or are considering getting the
internet there are many good deals out there. Below we have listed some good
broadband providers we have personally used.

* [Sky Broadband](https://www.sky.com/broadband) - recommended, 3 month contracts are also available.
* [Virgin Media](https://www.virginmedia.com) - if you are looking to use Virgin TV take the broadband with it. Might not be available in your area.
