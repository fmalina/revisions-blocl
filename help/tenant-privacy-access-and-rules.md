Tenant privacy access and rules
===============================
When taking in tenants, make them feel a welcome part of the household. Don’t
restrict tenants to their room, but let them have use of the communal room such
as living room, give them a great relaxing enjoyable stay.


Remember, if you’re a live out landlord, give at least 24 hours notice before
entering the property. Respect the tenants privacy. If you’re a live in landlord
these tenants will want privacy too, so when you’re doing your normal hoovering
around make sure you don’t go in to the tenant’s rooms without their permission.
He may not appreciate you seeing him in his new batman boxers.


It may be good, when the tenant is considering moving in, to discuss any
standard rules of the house, don’t create a list of a 100 rules the basics will
do, here are examples below:


* To always tidy away after themselves
* The rules on guests

* When rent and bills need paying

* Loud music
* Pets
