Writing your room wanted advert
===============================
When registering we recommend you place a room wanted advert as landlords don’t
just sit there waiting for e-mails or calls, they use our tenant database
searching for tenants looking for rooms in their area.

In this section we’ll give you a little advice on getting your room wanted
advert noticed. The best adverts give the reader a good insight into you and
what you’re looking for, seeing an advert that just says “need a big room this
week call me” might not quite have the effect you want it to, it’s not like
writing a dating site advert, so putting a little effort in to it will go a long
way.

If you look at it from the landlord’s point of view: they are letting a total
stranger into their property so the insight will make this process easier. Being
enthusiastic when writing your advert will get you the best response. Below is a
list to give you a head start on maybe what to mention and add. If you're still
stuck for inspiration, see the demo ad below or check out your rival ads.

* **Upload your pictures!**
* Where’s the location you would like to live?
* Is there a particular area in that location you want to live?
* Why do you want to move to there?
* Do you want to be close to i.e. University, shops, town etc?
* **What do you do for a living?**
* What hobbies do you have?
* What do you like doing to chill out?
* House facilities preference?
* **Are you tidy?**
* Your personality?
* Size of room you’re looking for?
* Housemate preference?
* Do you have kids or pets?

This all gives you further scope to finding a room faster, your advert works for
you even when you’re not online as people could be calling and e-mailing you
instead.
