Offering Sky or Virgin TV
=========================
Whilst providing Sky or Virgin TV may not be a major deciding factor for some
tenants, it does have many advantages, with some packages offering hundreds of
channels to choose from ranging from movies, sports, documentaries to music
giving everyone in the house something to enjoy.

These providers also offer multiroom this will allow tenants to watch Sky or
Virgin TV in there room. This way everyone is happy and gets to watch what they
want. If there’s a football fan in the house, but you are watching Corrie, they
don't have to miss out.

Packages normally start from around £17 a month, better packages from around £30
and adding multiroom to your package normally costs around £5-10 per month per
room. If Sky or Virgin is not for you, remember you can always pick up a
free-view box for as little as £15 and watch over 40 channels with no
subscription to pay.

So if you offer Sky or Virgin TV make sure you mention it in your advert as this
could help attract more interest.
