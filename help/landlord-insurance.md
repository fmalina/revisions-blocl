Landlord insurance
==================

When renting rooms it’s important to have the right protection in place to cover
for most eventualities. If you’re renting rooms in your own home or in other
properties, it can sometimes get a little stressful. The last thing you want to
think about is the bill because the ceiling has come through due to a tap left
running upstairs or your new LCD TV has been knocked over. Without insurance,
you’re left chasing tenants for excess costs not covered by the amount of their
bond. In some circumstances landlords have been left paying 1000s.    So it’s
best to play it safe and get appropriate Landlord Insurance. Normal home
insurance policies are unlikely to cover everything.


To help our customers we recommend users to search online for providers with
long-established expertise in providing specialist cover for landlords. Their
comprehensive and competitively priced policies have been specifically designed
to meet the needs of the modern landlord, offering both buildings and contents
cover and a monthly premium option as well as an annual one off payment.
