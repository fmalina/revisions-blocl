Looking for a room, but who do you want to live with?
=====================================================

When looking for a room it’s good to be clear on who you would like to live
with, it would be preferable with someone you like rather than making a rapid
decision and moving in to somewhere with people you don’t get along with. Some
things to consider when looking are:

* **Gender**: Would you prefer to live with males, females or no preference?
* **Age**: Do you mind the age of existing tenants or is there an age range you want to stick between?
* **Occupation**: Are you looking to share with students or professionals or no preference?
* **The type of tenants**: Are you looking for somewhere to put your head down or people you can have a beer and a social life with, do you mind the odd party?
* **Hygiene standards**: Do your hygiene standards match the ones of your potential housemates i.e. washing up, cleaning, general tidiness etc.?
* **Existing flatmates**: Have you met all the existing housemates do you get along with them?
* **Music**: Do you mind sharing with someone who likes to listen to music a lot, or vice versa you do and will it be ok with your new housemates?
* **Rules**: Are you ok with all the house rules, or is it not for you?
