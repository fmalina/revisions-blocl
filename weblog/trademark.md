Trademark, how to
=================

Getting Flatmate Rooms trademark registered with UK Intellectual Property
Office involved a few steps so here comes a little writeup of the process.
I hope it helps if you are going through a trademark application or just
inquisitive.


First the easy part: Headed over to [ipo.gov.uk](http://ipo.gov.uk), filled out
the forms, paid and soon recieved confirmation with trade mark
application attached.


…and than the hard part: Application was **not acceptable.** IPO raised an
objection to discuss. We needed **supporting documents and witness statement**
to go with it. So here it goes.

### TRADE MARKS ACT 1994


IN THE MATTER OF     Trade Mark Application No: UK00003019522     In the name
of: Flatmate Rooms Ltd     To register the mark: FLATMATE ROOMS     In Classes:
35 and 36


### WITNESS STATEMENT


1. I, Frantisek Malina am the director and co-founder of Flatmate Rooms ltd a
position which I have held since 2009. The facts in this statement come from my
personal knowledge or the records of my company and I am duly authorised to
speak on my company’s behalf in the prosecution of this application.
2. The trade mark FLATMATE ROOMS was first used in the United Kingdom in the year
2008.
3. FLATMATE ROOMS is an established UK community marketplace of landlords and
property owners finding trusted flatmates and tenants looking for better places
to live.


The goods/services on which the mark has been used, and the date of first use,
are as follows:


Class 35 - Advertising of rooms and residential real estate on the Internet
provided via a database first used in 2009


Class 36 - Agency for renting of residential premises first used in the year
2009
4. There is now produced and shown to me:


Exhibit JS1 which is a current screenshot of the homepage of the site that
received 24,740,000 pageviews to date from 2,450,000 unique visitors. Flatmate
Rooms website has currently 255,000 registered members and is steadily growing.


Exhibit JS2 which is a copy of the window sticker used by private landlords and
estate agents nationwide.


Exhibit JS3 which is a collection of hypertext references showing a sample of
public sector organisations who recommend Flatmate Rooms service, many of these
are also published in printed versions such as booklets for university students,
posters, council advice for tenants and landlord magazines. I have excluded
private sector references as we have generated over the years close to a hundred
of thousands due to heavy online, social and mobile advertising.


In these samples our service is referred to as Flatmate Rooms, FlatmateRooms,
Flatmate Rooms.co.uk or FlatMateRooms. All these spelling variations are used
throughout the web and hundreds of printed publications to refer to our site or
company and absolutely nothing else. Usage of space does not affect the meaning
as on its own both words are commonly used, together however they uniquely and
distinctively identify our company and service. I will also outline exclusions
based on searches within english written literature and publicly accessible
internet.
5. Annual sales of the services before the date of application were as follows:  

**2009** £1,668; **2010** £6,976; **2011** £57,910; **2012** £119,059; **2013** £165,584
6. Annual amounts spent on promoting the services before the date of application were as follows (excluding wages of directors who spend their work time developing the website and promoting the services):  


|  | Marketing,
 PPC & PR | Website costs | Print/Stationary
 Postage | Mobile
 marketing | Marketing
 staff wages | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2009 | £7,263.55 | £22,487.14 | £701.23 | £1,107.56 | £0.00 | £31,560 |
| 2010 | £4,598.09 | £7,153.13 | £613.39 | £926.55 | £0.00 | £13,290 |
| 2011 | £372.82 | £1,674.16 | £360.06 | £2,428.85 | £5,239.07 | £10,075 |
| 2012 | £1,404.25 | £2,164.65 | £232.99 | £2,977.08 | £9,003.68 | £15,783 |
| 2013 | £12,984.16 | £4,304.48 | £438.71 | £3,118.02 | £10,640.63 | £31,486 |
7. The mark has been used on the goods/services in the following parts of the United Kingdom:  

 England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland
8. The terms "flatmate rooms" and "flatmaterooms" distinctively represent our
company and are never used in natural english to refer to anything else, the
combination "flatmate rooms" does not appear due to syntax rules and semantics
of the words in english language. No web sites contain phrases Flatmate Rooms or
FlatmateRooms without referring to my firm as these would be only used to
identify our company and service.


Terms flatmates and room do appear close if used in the following combinations:


	* **…flatmate's room…** Note the apostrophe and the trailing s to denote
	possession, this is not what we claim to trademark.
	* **…visited by flatmates, rooms are available to rent…** Terms could appear close
	to each other if separated by a comma adjoining two sentences or in lists of
	plural keywords. This does not correspond to a phrase.I truly believe that as a result of the use made of it by my firm, the mark
FLATMATE ROOMS is well known to the landlords and lodgers renting out rooms in
the United Kingdom, and is uniquely associated with FLATMATE ROOMS Ltd, and that
this unique combination of words distinguishes the services sold by FLATMATE
ROOMS Ltd from other such service providers.
9. I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.


**Signed** F. Malina

All done. So now we can officialy show off with our registered trademark:


Flatmate Rooms ®


The problem is, I loathe it. It's an uppercase r in a circle pretending to be a
sticker sitting on a baseline. There's no superscript unicode codepoint for it
and if there was one it would be illegible at standard text size. How abysmal in
a browser title or PPC text advert, typographic nightmare. Back to good old ™.


Flatmate Rooms™, there. Better.
