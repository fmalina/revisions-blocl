Probably The Best Flatmates In The World
========================================


We all know and love the Carlsberg adverts, "probably the best beer in the
world", well this funny video was the advert from a few years ago showing the
best flatmates in the world.


In this video, it shows a man responding to an ad in the paper for a room to
rent, when he turns up he is greeted by a gorgeous girl, who likes football, a
laid back guy, and another beautiful girl who won't let anyone else cook.


The laid back guy shows our hero around the flat, showing off a wall gadget that
sucks up mess like a hoover at the touch of a button, then apologises for our
hero having the box room. On entering the room it is huge with batchelor pad
style decorations, then as they go onto the balcony they see the best bit of
all... the balcony overlooks a football stadium.


This advert amused many people when it came out and has been re released a few
times to go out before big football matches.


Is this what you want in a flat share? I'm sure many people would agree, but we
can't all be so lucky so what is important in a good flatmate?
