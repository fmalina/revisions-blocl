==============================

![Flatshare Fridge](/media/images/flatshare-fridge.jpg)


I could use one of these when I was [Flatsharing](/). This could be the new
future. Flatshare fridge that might finally stop tough arguments about who ate
my food or why do I have to clean up their mess. The fridge allows each person
in the household to have their own personal space. It consists of a base station
and up to 4 stackable sections.


Each compartment has a tall section for bottles as well as sections for
vegetables and even frozen foods. These sections can be further customized with
various colourful skins and add-ons like a whiteboard or bottle openers


The [Flatshare](/) Fridge was the winner of the Electrolux Design Lab
Competition and was created by Stefan Buchberger from the University of Applied
Arts in Vienna scoping a prize of 5000 and a six-month internship at one of
Electrolux global design centres.
