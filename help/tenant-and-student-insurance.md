missing. To help look after our users FlatMateRooms have teamed up with

"When I graduated from university I could not afford to buy my own home so I
remained in rented accommodation which was a shared house. As a tenant,
Endsleigh found me affordable contents insurance and I could pay it monthly.
When I came to claim they were excellent. There was almost no paperwork to
complete and the process was painless. I would definitely recommend them to
renters for household insurance."
