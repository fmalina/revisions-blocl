Parents Filling Empty Bedrooms
==============================
Are your children not your little babies no more, are they now all grown up and
made that decision to gain their own independence to stand on their own 2 feet
to move out of your family home?

Parents react in different ways many really missing their children, missing the
responsibility they had and others happy they don’t have to clean up after them,
forever borrowing them money and making all their meals.

But we all have the same decision what to do with the empty room? Does dad go
and buy a massive TV and turn it in to his cinema room or does mum turn it in to
a reading and relaxation room or like most people it ends up being a junk room
and over time it gets full of stuff you don’t use.

Or like many homeowners do you make that decision to rent out that empty room.

People do it for different reasons like:

* To bring in much-needed extra money
* To bring in fresh energy
* To have someone around the house
* Because there house is  to quiet
* To make new friends
* To help other people

Many homeowners have been earning themselves an extra £75 - £200 a Week.
