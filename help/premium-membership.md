Premium membership. How does it work?
=====================================
Flatmate Rooms offers a premium membership to help users succeeding faster and
support the [security of the service](/p40).


**Featured adverts** are highlighted on top of search results. These are all
**free to contact** without any upgrade prompts. Other active adverts are free
to contact as well. However you will be asked to upgrade and pass address
verification. If you choose to send messages for free, the recipient will be
prompted to become a premium member to read the message.


If you received a message that prompts you to check the premium membership, it
means both of you are basic members and message is still held back. One needs to
pass card address verification before conversation will be enabled. All senders
are made aware that you are not a premium member and asked whether they want to
become one.


Address verification happens automatically upon payment via card or PayPal
giving everyone piece of mind.

Why am I asked to upgrade to read a message?
--------------------------------------------


If you received a message that prompts you to check the premium membership, it
means both of you are basic members and message is still being delayed. One
needs to pass card address verification before conversation will be enabled. All
senders are made aware that you are not a premium member and asked whether they
want to become one.


Address verification happens automatically upon payment via card or PayPal
giving everyone piece of mind.


Why can’t it all just be free?
------------------------------


Sometimes we receive feedback from members asking to “make the website totally
free”.


While it would be nice to our basic members having us paying the running costs,
it wouldn’t be possible to ensure [safety of the service](/p40) and we couldn’t
afford to run the site:


* keeping spam and scams at bay
* regular updates and security
* keeping staff reviewing ads
* customer service
* marketing the website
* find landlords, find tenants
* pay staff and all running costs for the website (servers, domains etc)


You can now imagine the cost and amount of work involved to provide this
service.


Landlords: Having a vacant room costs 16 times the cost of premium membership.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Average double room rental is [£360 a month](/stats). Monthly membership with
success guarantee costs £25. That makes 1442% return on investment within a
month. The alternative is £360 loss having your room empty.     Premium members
are much more likely to attract attention. Scammers frequenting the free sites
took the trust out of the market. Card address verification returns our tenants
the piece of mind.


Flat Hunters: Good rooms go fast.
---------------------------------


Paying a small fee empowers flat hunters to jump the queue and stand out from
the crowd. All that’s necessary to get the right place before others will.


How do I upgrade?
-----------------


**[Choose your membership](/upgrade)** and let our service help find you a
tenant or room quicker and safer.


Can I get a boost on my premium membership?
-------------------------------------------


There are 3 ways how to get a boost:


1. With 30 days package, you can claim a guarantee
2. Renewing before your membership expires earns you 30% bonus
3. [Link to us and get 10 days credit](/linkboost)

We hope the above helps a little more in explaining why we charge for premium
membership and how it works.
