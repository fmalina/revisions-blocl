Male suicide prevention: a personal take
========================================
The ratio of male vs female suicide was 17.2 to 5.4, consistent over the past 10
years\*. This is relevant both to my maternal grandfather and my mother. My
grandfather, a university professor and a recognised inventor, had a broken
heart loosing his 2nd wife while my mother, an artist, carried out her
self-euthanasia quite recently, and with her extremely poor health having spoken
to a doctor we found out she did this with dignity and even professionalism.
These things are normal and they happen. What isn’t normal is the ratio. There
aren’t 3 times as many men in the UK\*, they are under three times the pressure.
This is one area where women also need to take the lead and catch up, take that
pressure off, equality won’t be achieved without this. **What can we do to
increase support for men?** Big white heterosexual men as all men need as much
help and support as any other group, not just pressure because they are
perceived to be strong. They aren’t stronger than this negative discrimination.

These are typically male issues but they affected my ill mother too having
cascaded down to her as a fallout of my own divorce.


When I got arrested on Stansted Airport by Merseyside Police for false
allegations by my ex wife right on the day of funeral of my own mother, there
was no apology from them after a release, not even ticket back to Stansted to
get my car and reunite me with my newborn girl born on the day of her
grandmother’s death. The only support I got was from working scouse men in the
Liverpool pub who bought me a beer after I walked in and called them “British
C\*nts”. Maybe this is the answer, we need killing the beer tax and pubs back on
for men to gather and discuss their issues in groups or we need to normalise
coming to pub without drinking, men only gyms as attractive and well equipped as
ladies only gyms. Men only cafes. Domestic violence helplines and organisations
for men funded just as much as those for women, we need a leadership movement
and voices as strong as those of feminists from the male camp, we need a
masculinist movement with a ratio of male vs female suicide as a success
indicator. Virus is being defeated, now let’s stop men from killing themselves.
Let’s figure out a path forward and let’s go
