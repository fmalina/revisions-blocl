Bedroom presentation
====================

The first impression of the rooms you offer are going to be key to your
potential flatmate or tenant making a decision, as to whether this is the right
property for them. If you find that the room you have to offer is in need of a
revamp, to help make it more appealing, the first place you should start is with
the walls. If it used to be your kids room or your old room maybe the Power
Rangers wall paper or the lilac paint might not be to the tenants taste. Stick
with simple natural colours. Check whether the carpet is ok. If it’s looking
tired or stained it may need cleaning or replacing.


Next you need to look at what you’re going to put in the room. Normally a good
furnished room will consist of a:


* Good quality bed
* Storage space
* Bedside table
* Lamp
* TV
* Rubbish bin
* Desk
* [Broadband access](/help/why-provide-internet-access), a big selling point.


You can find most things you need by visiting Argos and Ikea.


Remember that if you claim the £4250 [tax free rent a room
scheme](/help/the-rent-a-room-scheme) benefit, the room has to be furnished.


As this is going to be the tenant’s private space, you need to make the room as
spacious as possible by clearing out any unnecessary items including family
photos and personal artefacts. Make sure the bed is in the best position to make
the most of the room.


Next let’s have a dust around. If Fred the spider is looking at you from the
side of the room, tell him he’s not welcome any more. Gentle persuasion with a
TV magazine normally works best.


So now your room is clean, tidy and presentable, just remember to open windows
regularly, spray around and get ready for the viewings. Most of all, have fun.
