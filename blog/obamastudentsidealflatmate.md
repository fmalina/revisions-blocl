Yes you read it right, Barack Obama was named students ideal Flatmate in a
recent student poll.

Obama’s clean-living lifestyle, high intelligence and dynamism made him the
clear favourite housemate over UK politicians, a whole host of famous faces and
current housemates.

So it looks like David Cameron, Gordon Brown and Nick Clegg need to polish up
their skills to be more [student](/rooms/) and flatmate friendly.

The survey involved over 1,100 UK University students.

We were surprised to see that than 51% of students wanted to live with a tidy
and intelligent person, confessing the current [flatmates](/rooms/) drive them crazy
leaving a mess everywhere and eating each other’s food and only 14% crave a
‘rich and generous’ housemate and living with a ‘sexy and gorgeous’ flatmate was
even lower at only 11%. So budge over Paris Hilton and pull up a chair Mr Obama.
